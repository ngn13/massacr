# massacr ðŸ©¸ mass IP/port scanner

![](/assets/showcase.png)
a tool for scanning the internet for TCP ports 

## deploy
### docker
the project contains a scanner and a simple database with a web interface, easiest way to deploy these to is to use 
`docker-compose`, here is an example configuration:
```yml
version: "3"
services:
  scanner:
    image: ghcr.io/ngn13/massacr_scanner
    command: --url=http://database:3231 --pwd=securepassword --limit=100
    depends_on:
      - database

  database:
    image: ghcr.io/ngn13/massacr_database
    restart: unless-stopped
    environment:
      - PASSWORD=securepassword
    ports:
      - "127.0.0.1:3231:3231"
    volumes:
      - ./data:/app/data
```
after deploying the containers, you can access the web interface at `http://localhost:3231`.

### binaries
you can download the latest static binaries from the [releases page](https://github.com/ngn13/massacr/releases)

### from the source
another way to deploy these two applications, is to build them from the source.
- first install all the dependencies and build tools: 
```bash
build-esssential libnet libnet-dev curl curl-dev go
```
- then clone the repository: 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ngn13/massacr.git
```
- now change directory into the database and run the go build command:
```bash
cd massacr/database && go build .
```
- now change directory into the scanner and run the make command:
```bash 
cd ../scanner && make
```

## configuration
### database 
all the configuration options for the database are set using environment variables:
- `PASSWORD`: password, default is `default`
- `PORT`: port for the web server, default is `3231`

### scanner 
you can list all the options with `--help`:
```
--no-color => Do not print colored output
--recvport => Source port for TCP packets
--timeout  => Timeout for receiver thread
--ports    => Ports to scan for
--limit    => Packets per second limit
--debug    => Enable debug output
--url      => Database HTTP(S) URL
--pwd      => Database password
```

- options are set using the `--<option>=<value>` syntax
- for the `--ports` option, you can specify a single port, or you can specify ranges with `-` (`1-100`) and multiple ports with `,` (`80,443,1234`)
- timeout is the to wait after sending all the packets, as the receiver thread may fell behind
- `--limit` is set to 20 by default, **which is pretty slow, so you should increase it**

> [!CAUTION]
> DO NOT go overkill on the `--limit` option, you will most likely end up using all the bandwidth and crash the entire network

defaults for all the options are:
```
no-color => false
recvport => 13421
timeout  => 10
ports    => common
limit    => 20
debug    => false
url      => http://localhost:3231
pwd      => default
```
